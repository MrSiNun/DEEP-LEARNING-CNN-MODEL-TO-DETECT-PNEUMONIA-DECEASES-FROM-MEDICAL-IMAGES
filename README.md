## Introduction
The project explores three different approaches to train CNN models:
1. Class Weight Adjustment to handle imbalanced datasets.
2. K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure model generalizability.
3. Transfer Learning using ResNet15 for leveraging pre-trained models.

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 5,856 chest X-ray images categorized into "Normal" and "Pneumonia."
